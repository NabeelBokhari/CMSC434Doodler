Android Doodler Prototype
=========================

Running the app
---------------
Import the project into Android Studio, then use the run configurations menu to run the 
project on either an emulator or on a USB-connected Android device

Using the Doodler
-----------------
Swipe your finger across the screen to draw. By default, the pen is orange, thin, and completely opaque.

To change your drawing settings, tap the 'tools' button on the bottom left to open the tools menu. The available tools are:
- Color
- Pen Width
- Eraser
- Opacity

Selecting the eraser option from the tools menu allows you to erase your work. 
While erasing, you can change the width of the eraser using the pen width tool. 
When done erasing, go back into the tools menu and select a color to resume your drawing. 

You can tap on the undo button on the top left to undo your work stroke-by-stroke. You can continue to undo until you've undone
all of your work.

Finally, use the 'Clear Doodle' button on the bottom right to completely clear your drawing.

Happy doodling!
